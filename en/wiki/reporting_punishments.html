            <p>Reporting is a critical function for staff to be alerted of troublemakers on the servers as they happen. Staff can't answer every report sent and often miss reports so a good way is reporting on the website. More info about that below.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Reporting In-Game</h4>
            <p>When reporting a user in-game make sure that your reports are detailed. Do not message staff to check out a player that is breaking rules, do not call them out in chat and do not spam the report command. When sending a report these are some things you should know:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create reports in-game even if you plan on recording the user to then report them on the website. In some cases staff will be online that can deal with your report immediately instead of waiting for a response on the website.</li>
              <li>Do not spam the report command. Once every while is okay, not multiple times in a short period of time. This only includes reporting a player for the same reason, if you have things to add to your report you may send them again.</li>
              <li>Keep your reports concise and accurate. Staff doesn't need to read a paragraphs about the player you are reporting, they just need an accurate description of what they are doing wrong. An example of this could be "Forcefield, player's head snaps towars team mates".</li>
              <li>Do not be ambiguous. Report a player for exactly what they are doing, do not use general terms to describe a specific action. An example of something you should not report players for is "Trolling". Instead, report them for "Blocking own team's spawn".</li>
              <li>Do not use any sort of profanity in your reports. The sole purpose of them is to notify staff, not a place to vent your anger towards a hacker.</li>
              <li>Please use proper grammar and spelling if possible. Reports in all caps are not appreciated.</li>
              <li>Please be sure that the player you are reporting is actually breaking the rules. Do not stretch the truth when reporting players in order to receive staffs attention.</li>
              <li>You may report yourself if there is an issue with a map, server, or anything else that does not require you to report another specific player. An example being a wool room being out of wool, illegal lava, or other map issues like a server not cycling.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other things to keep in mind while reporting a player:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Staff does not respong to reports along the lines of "hacks" and most often one word reports.</li>
              <li>Abusing the report function in ways that do not pertain to reporting a player for breaking the rules can result in an infraction for the reporter.</li>
              <li>The report command is one of two steps you should use in order to remove troublemakers from the servers. In every situation you can, you should record or gather the appropriate evidence to file an online report for the player in the even that a moderator does not respond to your report in-game.</li>
              <li>When a moderator is responding to a report, please do not message them or tell them to "spec" a player.</li>
              <li>Do not ever alert the presence of a moderator to reduce chances of the rule breaker noticing and stopping what they are doing.</li>
              <li>Let moderators take as much time as they need to punish a player. Do not message them saying things along the lines of "See?", "Did you not see those obvious hacks?"</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>Reporting on the website</h4>
            <p>Now that we are over the in-game reporting function we will explain the website reporting system. Do not create a forum thread to report a player. If you are reporting a player on the website file a report on the <a href="https://oc.tc/report">report page</a>. Heres some things you should pay attention to while reporting:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Report the right person.</b> Make sure you spelled the persons name correctly. Double check for different numbers, subtle letters, etc.</li>
              <li><b>Record as an Observer.</b> It is much harder to determine what the player is doing if you+re on a team and in their face. If you have an above view and can follow them around for a while, it's much easier to see if they are hacking, lagging, or any other factor.</li>
              <li><b>Report IMMEDIATELY after the incident occurs.</b> Report the person as soon as you can. Don't wait till a lot of reports pile up and file them all at once. If you report a person with old evidence your report will be closed and the player won't be punished.</li>
              <li><b>Submit full screenshots.</b> When it comes to chat related offenses, send in the entire screenshots. It is necessary to know the context of the situation in order to punish the player. Do not send a screenshot of one line of text from the chat. You can remove your name from the screenshot.</li>
              <li><b>Multiple people reporting the same person.</b> Do not have multiple friends send in reports with you. It creates clutter and is innecessary. Only one report is needed. Dublicate reports will be closed, however if the evidence is different, it may be posted in the other report to keep track of.</li>
              <li><b>Multiple rule breakers.</b> If you record a video with multiple rule breakers you can edit the recording into multiple videos (one per person) or report each person individually. Do not send in one report for multiple people. If you do, only the person who you reported will be punished.</li>
              <li><b>"Long" videos.</b> If you have a video that could be considered long (5+ min) you can point out specific time stamps in the video so that staff members do not have to waste their time watching the entire thing or edit the video into smaller, specific segments where the rule breaking takes place.</li>
              <li><b>Specify dates and times.</b> When submitting a report, please say when you took the screenshot / recorded the video.  As stated previously, it is likely that the player will not be punished if the evidence is old.  Try to be as specific as possible.  This is necessary so the player isn't punished for something they've already been punished for.</li>
              <li><b>Always check if the users already been punished.</b> When reporting make sure that the user hasn't been punished for the same thing already.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Uploading your evidence is easy. If you are uploading video proof you can upload it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> but make sure that the video is set as unlisted. If you are uploading a screenshot you can use <a href="http://imgur.com/">Imgur</a>. It is easy to use and a great way to upload your evidence. Screenshots are only useful for chat related offenses.</p>
            <p>Keep the evidence. Do not delete it. Your evidence will always be needed. It is incredibly useful in appeals. There is no way to know when a player will appeal, if ever, so don't ever delete your evitence.</p>
            <p>Be patient with your reports. Staff gets a lot of reports daily so be patient. They will respond to website reports its just a matter of time.</p>
