            <p>A tournament is a team based PVP match where teams compete for an objective. The difference between a public match and a tournament match is teams are decided before the matches start. They are organized to be as efficient as possible and are watched over by refs (referees). Teams get a seed which then determines their place in the list of teams so really good teams don't end up playing a team that doesn't stand a chance against them. They are balanced as much as possible.</p>
            <p><b>What is a seed?</b> A seed is a ranking used in determining who faces who in an event. Teams are put into a list that is then organized by this seed which shows how good a team is based on first impressions.</p>
            <h4>Getting a team</h4>
            <p>A team is a group of players organized before the tournament starts. You can create your own on the website or join one if the leader of it invites you. If you are looking for a team or looking for members to join your team create a topic on the forums or check topics from others teams and players. There are subforums made exactly for this.</p>
            <p><b>What about registering my team?</b> Registrations usually open a couple weeks before the tournament starts so teams can get their members ready for the game. Theres a set amount of players you can have on a registered team. When you have those invites sent those players also need to confirm them otherwise your team won't be fully registered. When a team is registered it usually gets a server on the tournament IP for them to practice and get ready for the tournament. Abuse of the server will lead to the server being taken away. Event Coordinators made a forum thread with more information about that topic when the servers are given out.</p>
            <h4>Playing</h4>
            <p>A few minutes before your match starts a ref (referee) will come into your Mumble room. They will register you on the server where you will play. You are required to have a specific amount of players in Mumble during the game (its written on the main forum post by Event Coordinators). When on the server you will have some time to do your final preparations. When ready, or told by event staff you run the command to ready your team which then starts the match. Then you play the match as any other match and try to win.</p>
            <p><b>What is Mumble?</b> Mumble is a voice chat program similar to Teamspeak where players can communicate with others. While the Overcast Mumble server is always online teams are required to use it and be in their room during tournaments so they can communicate with the event staff. You can check the <a href="/en/guides/mumble">Mumble Guide</a> on our Guides section to learn more about it.</p>
