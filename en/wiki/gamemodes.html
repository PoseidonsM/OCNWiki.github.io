              <h2 id="tdm">Team Deathmatch</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Team Deathmatch is a gamemode where your main objective is to kill players on the enemy team. Most Team Deathmatch maps do not take advantage of the block breaking aspect of the game but there are some that do (Example: <a href="https://oc.tc/maps/battle_of_lyndanisse">Battle of Lyndanisse</a>). Maps have a score or a time limit set to them in which the team with the highest score wins. Some maps also feature a scorebox which is an area that you can enter to score extra points for your team (Example: <a href="https://oc.tc/maps/blockblock">BlockBlock</a>) and some maps feature villagers as a trading system to upgrade your gear (Example: <a href="https://oc.tc/maps/facility">Facility</a>).</p>

            <div class="page-header">
              <h2 id="ctw">Capture the Wool</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The objective in Capture the Wool maps is to grab the wool and take it back to your victory monument usually located near spawn. In most maps you have to grab the wool from a wool room located on the enemy side and bring it back to your side to capture it by placing it in the monument. There are some exceptions like CTW Blitz maps where the wool is located in the middle of the map and teams fight for who gets it first and brings it back to their own side before getting killed. In the wool room you will oftenly find extra items that will help you escape and bring the wool back to your own side (Example: Better Armor).</p>
            <p>While you are trying to capture the enemy team's wool, they will also be trying to capture yours so you have to defend your wool room. On a lot of maps there is a small pre-made defence already put in place by the map's creators but it is always important that you make a defence to prevent enemies coming into your own wool. On most maps there is no time limit but there are some exceptions.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="page-header">
              <h2 id="ctf">Capture the Flag</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Capture the Flag is a fairly new gamemode. It is quite similar to Capture the Wool. You have to go to the enemy team's side, steal their flag (you do that by walking over it) and bring it back into "the net" that is located somewhere on your side (usually near your own flag).</p>
            <p>There are a few exceptions though. "King of the Flag" is a mode where the flag is placed in the middle of the map and teams have to battle it out for which one will take it to their side first.</p>
            <p>Capture the Flag can work really nicely with Team Deathmatch where you can have flag captures give a team a set amount of points. The amount can be different for maps because its set in its XML.</p>

            <div class="page-header">
              <h2 id="dtc">Destroy the Core</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Destroy the Core is a gamemode where the objective is to leak lava out of the enemy team's core while preventing the enemies to leak yours. On most maps the core it obsidian at start and then uses modes to change after time.</p>
            <p>By default the core will change from obsidian into gold at 15 minutes and into glass at 20 minutes but that time can be changed by the map creator if he decides to do so in XML. Maps can have multiple cores and can also be used with another gamemode (Example: <a href="https://oc.tc/maps/spaceship_battles">Spaceship Battles</a>).</p>
            <br>
            <div class="page-header">
              <h2 id="dtm">Destroy the Monument</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Destroy the Monument is a gamemode where the objective is to destroy a monument that is located on the enemy team's side while protecting your own. Monuments can have modes where they change after some time (Example: From obsidian to beacon) and can also work with Destroy the Core to create a Mixed gamemode map (Example: <a href="https://oc.tc/maps/spaceship_battles">Spaceship Battles</a>).</p>
            <br>
            <div class="page-header">
              <h2 id="koth">King of the Hill</h2>
            </div>
            <p>King of the Hill is a map where your main objective is to capture the hill and prevent the enemies from taking it from you. To capture a hill you simply stand on top of it. To win you have to reach the max amount of points before the other teams or have more points before the time runs out (if the map has a time limit).</p>
            <br>
            <div class="page-header">
              <h2 id="blitz">Blitz</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Blitz is a gamemode that is very similar to Team Deathmatch. The main objective is to eliminate the enemies before the time runs out. The twist is you only have a limited amount of lives so you have to be careful. You cannot join a match in progress.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="page-header">
              <h2 id="rage">Rage</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Rage is a gamemode that is the same as Blitz. You have a limited amount of lives and you have to eliminate the enemies before the time runs out. The twist on Rage is that the weapons are one-hit kill which makes every swing and shot very dangerous.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="page-header">
              <h2 id="gs">Ghost Squadron</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Ghost Squadron is a gamemode based heavily on kits. You select a kit to spawn with and when the match starts you will be invisible to the enemies. The objective is to eliminate all enemy players but finding them will be tricky. Depending on the situation you might easily be able to track down an enemy if they will have an arrow inside of them or have experience orbs following them. One of the most important things you should look for is particles. Like in Blitz you cannot join a match mid-game.</p>
